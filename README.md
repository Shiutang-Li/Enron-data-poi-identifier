The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning and transformation methods, along with various machine learning algorithms, to build identifiers to predict who is a POI (person of interest) based on the Enron data set. POI means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
